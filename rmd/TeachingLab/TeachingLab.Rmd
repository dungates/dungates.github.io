# The Flow of Race and Education

This circle diagram shows how each race listed distributes amongst the various levels of educational attainments, there are some very obvious patterns that emerge as you specify each group by mousing over it. The sums of each racial group is 100, but the sums of the educational categories are larger than 100 because it is accounting for each race separately and the data is in percentages, but it is a useful visualization nonetheless. The data is pulled from the 2017 census.

```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F, fig.height=15}
library(chorddiag)
library(readxl)
race_education_data <- read_excel("/Users/dunk/Downloads/Book1.xlsx")
race_education_data_2 <- race_education_data %>% select(-`...1`) %>% mutate_if(is.numeric, .funs = funs(.*100))
test_matrix <- as.matrix(race_education_data_2)

colnames(test_matrix) <- c("All", "American Indian or Alaska Native", "Asian", "Black", "Hispanic", 
                                       "Pacific Islander", "White", "More than one race")

rownames(test_matrix) <- c("Less than high school", "High school graduate", "Some college",
                                            "Associate degree", "Bachelor's degree", "Master's degree", "Professional degree", 
                                            "Doctoral degree")



groupColors <- c(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, "Blues"))
chorddiag(test_matrix, type = "bipartite", 
          groupColors = groupColors,
          groupnamePadding = 20, showTicks = F, categorynameFontsize = 0, groupnameFontsize = 12)
```

The next two images show some of the basic geography of the US in terms of education and race, these are a lot more useful in county level data, but together these two maps show that most of the US does not complete college, and is very racially-geographically compounded unless you are white.

Below I analyze data from UNESCO's Institute of Statistics, the World Development Indicators Database (WDI), and evaluate the impact of student-teacher ratio's on education taking into context different levels of wealth. The UNESCO data can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-05-07/student_teacher_ratio.csv), and the WDI data can be imported easily with the following code

```{warning = F}
library(WDI)
WDIsearch("public.*education") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  tbl_df() %>%
  arrange(str_length(name)) %>%
  View()
```

# Data Exploration

First I separate the data into two different type: primary education, and secondary education. First I investigate primary education:

```{r echo = F, fig.width = 10}
student_teacher_ratio_2015 <- student_ratio %>%
  dplyr::filter(indicator == "Primary Education",
         year == 2015,
         !is.na(student_ratio))
student_teacher_ratio_2015 %>%
  arrange(desc(student_ratio)) %>%
  slice(c(1:10, seq(n() - 10, n()))) %>%
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, student_ratio)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(country, student_ratio, fill = student_ratio)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  coord_flip() +
  expand_limits(y = 0) +
  labs(title = "Countries with Highest and Lowest Student/Teacher Ratios",
       x = "",
       y = "Student/Teacher ratio",
       caption = "Primary education as defined by UNESCO",
       fill = "Student-Teacher Ratio %") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

It appears that student/teacher ratio is negatively correlated with country wealth, both per capita and total. There are, however, some exceptions - the US, UK, and Switzerland do not have low student/teacher ratios, while relatively low income countries like Cuba, Greece, and Georgia do have lower ratios.

```{r echo = F, warning = F}
library(WDI)
WDIsearch("public.*education") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  tbl_df() %>%
  arrange(str_length(name)) %>%
  View()
```

The distribution of student-teacher ratio has a slight right skew, and is almost bimodal.

```{r echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
indicators_raw <- WDI(indicator = c("NY.GDP.PCAP.CD", "SP.POP.TOTL", "SE.ADT.LITR.ZS",
                                    "SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS",
                                    "SE.SEC.NENR.MA", "SE.SEC.NENR.FE"),
                      start = 2015, end = 2015, extra = TRUE) %>%
  tbl_df()
indicators <- indicators_raw %>%
  select(country_code = iso3c,
         region,
         NY.GDP.PCAP.CD:SE.SEC.NENR.FE) %>%
  mutate(country_code = as.character(country_code))
student_teacher_ratio_2015 %>%
  ggplot(aes(student_ratio)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "white") +
  geom_density(fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(student_teacher_ratio_2015$student_ratio, na.rm = T), color = "red", linetype = "dashed", size = 1.5) +
  geom_text(aes(label = "Mean Student-Teacher Ratio\n              (22.81%)", x = mean(student_teacher_ratio_2015$student_ratio, na.rm = T), y = 12), hjust = -0.08, color = "red") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "Student-Teacher Ratio", y = "Count", title = "Distribution of Student to Teacher Ratio") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Country Per Capita Wealth vs. Student/Teacher Ratio

```{r echo = F, warning = F, fig.width = 10}
student_teacher_ratio_2015 %>%
  inner_join(indicators, by = "country_code") %>%
  arrange(desc(SP.POP.TOTL)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(NY.GDP.PCAP.CD, student_ratio)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = SP.POP.TOTL, color = region)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), vjust = 1, hjust = 1, check_overlap = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "lm", color = "black") +
  ggpmisc::stat_poly_eq(aes(label = paste(stat(eq.label),
                                  stat(adj.rr.label), sep = "*\", \"*")),
               formula = y ~ x, rr.digits = 3, coef.digits = 4,
               parse = TRUE, label.x = "right") +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(), range = c(.25, 12)) +
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita (US $)",
       y = "Student/Teacher Ratio",
       title = "GDP Per Capita vs. Student-Teacher Ratio in 2015",
       color = "Region",
       size = "Population") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

There is clearly a negative correlation between a country's wealth and its student/teacher ratio.

## What Other Indicators Have an Impact?

There's a bunch of other factors to test from WDI data, literacy has an obvious negative association with student-teacher ratio which is likely also strongly associated with country wealth, and secondary school enrollment follows the same logic showing a steady rate of increase with GDP per capita. Finally, looking at secondary school enrollment and student/teacher ratio, wealth appears to play the biggest roll again as there is significant negative association, but most countries clustered in the upper left are once again at the top of most GDP per capita rankings (PPP adjusted or otherwise).

```{r echo = F, warning = F, fig.width = 10}
student_teacher_ratio_2015 %>%
  inner_join(indicators, by = "country_code") %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(SE.ADT.LITR.ZS)) %>%
  mutate(literacy = SE.ADT.LITR.ZS / 100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(student_ratio, literacy, color = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), vjust = 1, hjust = 1, check_overlap = TRUE) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(y = "Literacy", x = "Student-Teacher Ratio") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


```{r echo = F, warning = F, fig.width = 10}
joined <- student_teacher_ratio_2015 %>%
  inner_join(indicators, by = "country_code") %>%
  mutate(secondary_enrollment = (SE.SEC.NENR.MA + SE.SEC.NENR.FE) / 2)
joined %>%
  arrange(desc(SP.POP.TOTL)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(NY.GDP.PCAP.CD, secondary_enrollment, color = region)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), vjust = 1, hjust = 1, check_overlap = TRUE) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita (US $)",
       y = "Secondary school enrollment") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

```{r echo = F, warning = F, fig.width = 10}

       y = "Secondary school enrollment") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

# Models and Post Hoc Analysis

## Linear Regression

I developed a couple simple models just to get a numerical idea of the data, for each 1% increase in secondary enrollment a 0.449 decrease in student-teacher ratio is expected, and for each 1 point increase in GDP per capita a 6.817 point decrease in the student-teacher ratio is expected. 

<center>
```{r echo = F, warning = F, results = 'asis', fig.align='center'}
ols1 <- joined %>%
  transmute(student_ratio,
            secondary_enrollment,
            log2_gdp = log2(NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)) %>%
  cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
ols1 <- lm(student_ratio ~ secondary_enrollment, data = joined)
ols2 <- lm(student_ratio ~ log(NY.GDP.PCAP.CD), data = joined)
stargazer::stargazer(ols1, ols2, type = "html", style = "qje",
                     dep.var.labels = "Student Ratio",
                     covariate.labels = c("Secondary Enrollment", "GDP Per Capita (US$)"))
```
