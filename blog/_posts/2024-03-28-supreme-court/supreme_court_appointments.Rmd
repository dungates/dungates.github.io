  In a time where the completely impartial Supreme Court is continually accused of being politically biased, it is worth considering which party has more strongly controlled the nomination process. This post explores various dimensions of appointee data over the last 150 years, concluding with a rolling mean score of how many appointees are appointed by each party that shows a shocking trend!

Since Harry Reid took the nuclear option in 2013 to reduce the cloture threshold for nominations, the idea that the Supreme Court is a non-partisan institution has been under severe threat. Subsequently, in 2017 the use once again by Mitch McConnell established a long running trend as a precedent - that of extreme partisan interest in every Supreme Court justice. This is clearly evident in the trend of votes for/against nominees, as well as the veto rate on nominees. An interesting, and annoying feature of nominations I idscovered while conducting research on this is that [voice votes](https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/voting.htm#:~:text=In%20a%20voice%20vote%2C%20the,of%20votes%20are%20not%20recorded.) in the Senate do not record any votes, and simply report whether or not the vote was approved, meaning that of 165 votes in the senate we instead only get 98 votes with which to gauge justice approval. Despite this setback, quickly using `rvest` to get the data to visualize [official Senate data](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/nominations/SupremeCourtNominations1789present.htm) shows the following: 

```{r preview = TRUE}
library(rvest)

senate_page <- read_html("https://www.senate.gov/legislative/nominations/SupremeCourtNominations1789present.htm")

nomination_table <- senate_page |>
  rvest::html_elements(".contenttext") |>
  purrr::pluck(2) |>
  rvest::html_table() |>
  dplyr::slice(-2) |>
  dplyr::select(-2, -4, -6, -8, -10) |>
  janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 1) |>
  dplyr::rename(Replace = 2,
                Nominated = 3,
                Vote = 4,
                Result = 5,
                Date = 6) |>
  dplyr::filter(Result %in% c("C", "N", "W", "P", "D", "R")) |>
  dplyr::mutate(Vote = stringr::str_replace_all(Vote, "\\s.*", ""),
                For = as.character(stringr::str_extract(Vote, ".*(?=-)")),
                Against = as.character(stringr::str_extract(Vote, "(?<=-).*")),
                Date = as.Date(Date, format = "%b %d, %Y"),
                Nominated = as.Date(Nominated, format = "%b %d, %Y"))

nomination_table |>
  dplyr::filter(Vote != "V") |>
  dplyr::select(-Vote) |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = c(For, Against), names_to = "Vote", values_to = "Count") |>
  tidyr::drop_na(Count) |>
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(Date)) |>
  dplyr::mutate(Count = as.numeric(Count)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Nominated, y = Count, fill = Vote)) +
  geom_area(position = position_stack()) +
  # facet_wrap(~ Nominee) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#040404", "#04abeb")) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "10 years", 
               date_labels = "%Y", 
               limits = as.Date(c("1795-01-01", "2024-01-01"))) +
  DGThemes::theme_duncan()
```

It seems pretty clear from this visual that there has been a massive increase in votes against approval of supreme court justices over the last approximately 20 years. One could of course claim that this doesn't account for control of the senate, but here is a chart showing senate composition over the last 40 years, which should be immediately make clear the question of that necessity.

```{r dems-reps-sen, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("_posts/2024-03-28-supreme-court/sen_composition.png"))
```

Just to make sure we're not missing anything here, lets also look at the data on whether or not appointees were confirmed, declined, withdrawn, rejected, postponed, or no action was taken.

```{r confirmed-or-other}
nomination_table |>
  dplyr::mutate(Date = as.factor(as.numeric(lubridate::year(Date)))) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = 1, fill = Result)) +
  geom_col(width = 2) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c("1800", "1861", "1902", "1941", "1981", "2022")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = MetBrewer::met.brewer("Archambault", n = 6),
                    labels = c("C" = "Confirmed",
                               "N" = "No Action",
                               "R" = "Rejected",
                               "D" = "Declined",
                               "P" = "Postponed",
                               "W" = "Withdrawn")) +
  DGThemes::theme_duncan() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        legend.direction = "horizontal",
        legend.position = "bottom")
```
That "No Action" sure pops up out of nowhere, wow! Even more interestingly you can see that there is a long period of confirmations from the late 1800s up to about 1970-1990 when a few famous rejections take place - those of Clement Haynsworth Jr., Harrold. G. Carswell, and Robert H. Bork. One last interesting blip here is that of Harriet Miers withdrawn nomination in 2005, where in the face of bipartisan opposition President George Bush did a rare political takeback. This withdrawal was a fascinating [wikipedia read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Miers#Supreme_Court_nomination_and_withdrawal) that I was mostly unfamiliar with due to being 6 years old at the time, but the idea of Lindsey Graham and Sam Brownback asking the President's office for a letter "in order to elucidate her views on political matters" is unthinkable in the modern era (and in light of the fact that the Supreme Court is of course apolitical!!). 

My last statement on this is that it is pretty clear from the data, and historical viewpoint (that I don't have time to devolve into right now), that after the initial turmoil of the Supreme Court's establishment due to a lack of clarity in Article 3, Marbury v. Madison, slavery and the Civil War (okay tiny little dive into the history) there was an established precedent of concord on the Supreme Court that FDR briefly tried to break, and then the Republicans demolished in the 70s and 80s. The shocking lack of response from the Democratic party in this regard is showcased in the data as there is no political blowback until too late in 2013. If it's too late, what can be done now? In the clearly apolitical landscape of the Supreme Court you would think nothing, but if you look at Supreme Court tenureship you might actually think, well, something.

Taking a look at the data for Republican vs. Democratic nominees tenureship and appointment rates we see more of the same trend, and more of a solution for the Democratic party.
